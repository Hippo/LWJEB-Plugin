# LWJEB-Plugin
LWJEB with RLE all in a spigot plugin.

# Deprecated
This is kept for archival purposes, if you wish to use LWJEB in your plugin consider shading it within your plugin.


If you are a server owner and one of your plugins requires this, just check the releases tab and download the jar and toss it in your plugins folder.


If you are a plugin developer, I would look at the LWJEB and RLE repositories (on my page) for more information about the library.
